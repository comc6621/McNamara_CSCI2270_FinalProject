# McNamara_CSCI2270_FinalProject
For our poject, Joe Castagneri and I, Conor McNamara, built the game checkers.  It is a two player game that our program creates and runs by building a graph and displaying the nodes as pieces on the board. All of the specific rules of checkers are displayed in the rules option as the program initially starts. Our program checks piece movement, kinging a piece, jumping a piece, and so on by having the nodes in the graph interact with one another. It also keeps score of the pieces that are remaining for each team. Enjoy
